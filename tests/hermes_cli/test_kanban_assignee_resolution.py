"""Assignee ingress: the display spelling must round-trip to a routable value, and
a name the dispatcher can never spawn for must be refused at the writer.

Regression for kanban card t_9080ae81. Notifications render the assignee as
``@name`` (``gateway/kanban_watchers_notifier`` attribution tag); an agent read
its own notification, passed ``@default`` back into card creation, and the value
was stored verbatim. The dispatcher resolves assignees with
``profiles.profile_exists``, which can never match ``@default``, so seven cards
sat in ``ready`` with no worker, no error and no event — while the gateway's
"dispatcher stuck" warning sent the operator to profile health, which was fine.

The contract these tests hold:
  1. a mention-style assignee is normalized to the profile name it names;
  2. a name that resolves to no profile is rejected where it is written;
  3. a row that still carries one (pre-guard, or written by an external tool) is
     not silent — it records exactly one ``skipped_nonspawnable`` event and the
     dispatcher's health notice names it.
