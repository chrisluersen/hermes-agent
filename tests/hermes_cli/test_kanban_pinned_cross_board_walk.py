"""Cross-board load walks must survive the worker's ``HERMES_KANBAN_DB`` pin.

The dispatcher spawns every worker with ``HERMES_KANBAN_DB`` pinned to *that
worker's* board file (``kanban_db_dispatch._default_spawn``), and the pin
outranks the ``board=`` slug inside ``kanban_db_path``. So a cross-board walk
that resolves each slug through that resolver maps every board onto the worker's
own file, dedups them all away, and reports ``0`` / ``{}`` — from inside exactly
the process the host-level (``max_in_progress``) and per-profile
(``max_in_progress_per_profile``) caps exist to bound.

The pin does not mean "all boards share one file". It means "this process
belongs to ONE board", so enumerating the others must not go through it.

Reachability of the pinned path, with evidence: ``hermes kanban dispatch`` run
in a worker's terminal inherits the pin — the worker's shell has
``HERMES_KANBAN_DB=<its board>/kanban.db`` (verified on a live worker) and a
child process does not scrub it (``agent/secret_scope.py`` lists
``HERMES_KANBAN_*`` as genuinely-global, and the terminal tool passes it
through). ``kanban_ops._cmd_dispatch`` then connects with ``connect_closing()``
— the pinned file — and calls ``dispatch_once(conn, ...)`` with no ``board``.

These tests mirror the unpinned pair in ``test_kanban_host_cap.py``
(``test_max_in_progress_counts_other_boards``) with the pin set, so the two
suites read as one before/after pair.
