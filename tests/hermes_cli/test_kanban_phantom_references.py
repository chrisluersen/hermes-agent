"""Cross-board ``t_<hex>`` citations must not read as fabricated references.

The post-completion prose scan looked the cited ids up in the completing board's
own ``tasks`` table, so a worker that correctly cited a real task living on
ANOTHER board — the sibling writer that caused the condition it was reporting —
was recorded as ``suspected_hallucinated_references`` (board ``hermes-growth``,
``task_events`` row 1066). Both cited ids were real. A citation is a mention, not
a claim of authorship: it resolves on any LIVE board.

The companion arms are the boundaries this must not cross: an id no board
resolves is still flagged, and ``created_cards`` — which IS a claim of
authorship — stays board-local and keeps blocking.
